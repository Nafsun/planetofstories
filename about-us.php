			The planet of Stories is a website with the main aim of allowing people to share different kinds of stories such as happy,
			funny, and sad stories among themselves. It also allows people to share their true life experience stories for other people to share
			their thought and feeling. The aim is to make a connection between people by allowing them to share what's happening within their 
			surrounding with other people. A person not only can share stories of his life experience but also what they have witness with their 
			eyes somewhere else. This allows a person to know whats happening to other people within and outside their locality through our platform.
			People who are in need of money from the rich can use our platform to share their needs and if any rich man see their problems, he can easily
			contact them to help them.
